I will be writing my notes here and commands used to make this run
command:
docker ps               :tells you whats running
ctrl + l                :clears the terminal

docker exec -it postgres bash  : allows us to execute shell commands within the container
^ for this above to create the database I went into my postgresql app and added the database through my local terminal
I tried doing it through here but I just couldn't connect the servers together

\c customer
You are now connected to database "customer" as user "melissasantos".


when you lookup the database in the terminal that is you interacting with it
vs
when using postman it is going through out API and getting data back

POST is for adding a new resource.
    -the source will be in this JSON object


Type this into the terminal in the customer data base to insert into the data base:
INSERT INTO customer(id,name,email,age)
VALUES (nextval('customer_id_sequence'),'Tyler','tpagela@ucsd.edu',22);

localhost:8080/api/v1/customers

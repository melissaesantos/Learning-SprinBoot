I will be writing my notes here and commands used to make this run
command:
docker ps               :tells you whats running
ctrl + l                :clears the terminal

docker exec -it postgres bash  : allows us to execute shell commands within the container
^ for this above to create the database I went into my postgresql app and added the database through my local terminal
I tried doing it through here but I just couldn't connect the servers together

\c customer
You are now connected to database "customer" as user "melissasantos".
